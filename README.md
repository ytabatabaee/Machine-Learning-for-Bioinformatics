# Machine Learning for Bioinformatics

These are my solutions to the assignments of CE550 offered by the CE Department at Sharif University in Spring quarter of 2020.

## Assignments
1. Heart Disease Data Analysis with KNN and Decision Tree from scratch [Codes & Data](https://github.com/ytabatabaee/Machine-Learning-for-Bioinformatics/tree/master/knn_decision_tree)
2. Analyzing the Sklearn Breast Cancer dataset using Soft Margin SVM and Perceptron algorithms. [Codes](https://github.com/ytabatabaee/Machine-Learning-for-Bioinformatics/tree/master/svm_perceptron)
3. Analyzing the Sklearn Breast Cancer dataset using Ensemble Algorithms and Feature Selection. [Codes](https://github.com/ytabatabaee/Machine-Learning-for-Bioinformatics/tree/master/ensemble_feature_selection)
4. Dimensionality Reduction using PCA and Clustering with K-means and GMM on ALL/AML cancer dataset [Codes](https://github.com/ytabatabaee/Machine-Learning-for-Bioinformatics/tree/master/clustering)
